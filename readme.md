# tiny webserver rce exploit

This is a collection of exploits for a simplified fork of the tiny http webserver https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server , known to have a buffer overflow.

The goal is to showcase the evolution of memory safety mitigations and exploitation techniques over the years,
in a semi-realistic environment.

The webserver has been compiled four times, with increasing levels of memory protections.
For every version, I've written an exploit that defeats the mitigations and launches a remote shell:

- [tiny.1996](https://github.com/robalb/tiny-webserver-rce-exploit/blob/master/expl_1996.py) : no protections. Compiled statically, with an executable stack and no canaries like it's 1996
- tiny.canary: executable stack, but with stack canaries enabled
- tiny.nx: both canary and nx protection active
- tiny.all: all protections active: canary, nx, ASLR, relro

All these binaries have Indirect Branch Tracking enabled, but are expected to run on
an intel cpu preceding the ~2020 Tiger Lake line, where this security feature is not yet supported

## rationale

There is a treasure trove of small webservers written in c that can be found
on github.
They are usually just learning exercises, not intended to run in production,
but their simplicity and the fact that they follow an accept-fork model makes them
a great target for writing beginner-friendly exploits.
