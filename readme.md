# tiny webserver rce exploit

This is a collection of exploits for a simplified fork of the tiny http webserver https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server , known to have a buffer overflow.

The goal is to showcase the evolution of memory safety mitigations and exploitation techniques over the years,
in a semi-realistic environment.

The webserver has been compiled four times, with increasing levels of memory protections.
For every version, I've written an exploit that defeats the mitigations and launches a remote shell:

- [tiny.1996](https://github.com/robalb/tiny-webserver-rce-exploit/blob/master/expl_1996.py) : no protections. Compiled statically, with an executable stack and no canaries like it's 1996
- [tiny.canary](https://github.com/robalb/tiny-webserver-rce-exploit/blob/master/expl_canary.py): executable stack, but with stack canaries enabled
- tiny.nx: both canary and nx protection active
- [tiny.all](https://github.com/robalb/tiny-webserver-rce-exploit/blob/master/expl_all.py): all protections active: canary, nx, ASLR, relro


### running the server
```
(pkill tiny || true) && strace -f ./bin/tiny.all
```

### open a debugger at the beginning of the rop chain
```
./debug.sh
```
