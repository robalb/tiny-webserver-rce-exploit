# tiny webserver rce exploit

There is a treasure trove of small webservers written in c that can be found
on github.
They are usually just learning exercises, not intended to run in production,
but their simplicity and the fact that they follow an accept-fork model makes them
a great target for writing beginner-friendly exploits

This repository includes a simplified fork of the tiny http webserver
https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server
known to have a buffer overflow.

The webserver has been compiled four times, with increasing levels of memory protections.
For every version, a full remote code exploit has been written.

- tiny.1996 : no protections. Compiled statically, with an executable stack and no canaries like it's 1996
- tiny.canary: executable stack, but with stack canaries enabled
- tiny.nx: both canary and nx protection active
- tiny.all: all protections active: canary, nx, ASLR, relro

All these binaries have Indirect Branch Tracking enabled, but are run on
an intel cpu preceding the 2020 Tiger Lake processors wich is the first one with
support for this security feature
