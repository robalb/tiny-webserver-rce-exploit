# tiny webserver rce exploit

This repository includes a simplified fork of the tiny http webserver
https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server
known to have a buffer overflow.

The webserver has been compiled four times, with increasing levels of memory protections.
For every version, an exploit that defeats the mitigations and launches a remote shell has been written.

- [tiny.1996](https://github.com/robalb/tiny-webserver-rce-exploit/blob/master/expl_1996.py) : no protections. Compiled statically, with an executable stack and no canaries like it's 1996
- tiny.canary: executable stack, but with stack canaries enabled
- tiny.nx: both canary and nx protection active
- tiny.all: all protections active: canary, nx, ASLR, relro

All these binaries have Indirect Branch Tracking enabled, but are expected to run on
an intel cpu preceding the ~2020 Tiger Lake line, wich is the first one supporting this security feature

## rationale

This projects aims at showcasing the evolution of memory safety mitigations and exploitation techniques over the years,
in a semi-realistic environment

There is a treasure trove of small webservers written in c that can be found
on github.
They are usually just learning exercises, not intended to run in production,
but their simplicity and the fact that they follow an accept-fork model makes them
a great target for writing beginner-friendly exploits.
