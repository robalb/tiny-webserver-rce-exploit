There is a treasure trove of small webservers written in c that can be found
on github.
They are usually just learning exercises, not intended to run in production,
but their simplicity and the fact that they follow an accept-fork model makes them
a great target for writing beginner-friendly exploits

This is a list of the projects i've looked at

known bof, sadly based on buggy pre-fork model: forks before accept (375 stars!)
clean code
https://github.com/shenfeng/tiny-web-server

worst code ever, cpp, full of user-after-double-free, fork (271 stars!)
so many vulns that exploitation is not possible
https://github.com/Dungyichao/http_server

clean code, very small, fork. don't see vulns (154 stars!)
https://github.com/ankushagarwal/nweb

fork, no vulns, identical to nweb, (55 stars)
https://github.com/labcoder/simple-webserver

not a unix environment, too far from what i want
https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer
https://github.com/depau/wi-se-sw/tree/main/fakeesp

fork , probably has some good-looking bof  (1 star!)
https://github.com/blghns/Simple-Web-Server-in-C/blob/master/webServer.c
